        "Randomised select reorders the array, while quick select searches in place.  Quick select also counts the values that are lower than the pivot value whereas randomised select determines the position of the pivot value via partition.  Quick select does not know where the pivot value is, only how many values are on either side of it.\n",

        "The worst case for the quick select algorithm would be if the random choice was always at either the lowest or highest value, meaning the list only shrinks by one each iteration.  This is O(N^2).  The random nature will prevent the dataset from impacting runtime too much.\n"
